    "text": "Abstract. This article investigates the effects of optimism shocks on the Australian economy using a Bayesian Structural Vector Autoregression (BSVAR) model. We implement the sign and zero restrictions algorithm proposed by (Arias, Rubio-Ramı́rez, and Waggoner 2018) to identify the optimism shock. Impulse response functions (IRF) and forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) are used to analyse the effects of the optimism shock on five key macroeconomic variables: productivity, stock prices, consumption, real interest rate and hours worked.\nKeywords. Bayesian Structural VAR, sign restrictions, zero restrictions, optimism shock"

    "text": "ACF and PACF plot\n\n\n\n\n\nThe autocorrelation function (ACF) plot shows all variables have a consistent pattern of autocorrelation, this suggests that the time series are non-stationary. Stationarity is formally tested using the Augmented Dickey-Fuller test in the next section.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe partial autocorrelation function (PACF) plot shows that the partial autocorrelation of all variables is significant at lag 1, real interest rate is also significant at lag 2. Therefore, choosing a lag length for the VAR model greater than or equal to 2 is reasonable, following convention for quarterly data, we will adopt a lag length of 4 for the VAR model."

    "text": "Interpretation\nThe impulse response function (IRF) of the SVAR model is used to interpret the effect of the optimism shock on the endogenous variables. Specifically, we are interested in whether a positive optimism shock leads to a simultaneous boom in consumption and hours worked (as in the United States).\nThe forecast error variance decomposition (FEVD) is used to quantify the relative importance of the optimism shock in explaining the variability of a \\(h\\)-step ahead forecast of a particular variable. For example, we will examine the proportion of the variability of consumption and hours worked explained by the optimism shock."
